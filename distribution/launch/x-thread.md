**Tweet 1 (hook)**
```
I built an Android app that connects to your self-hosted AI coding agent.

Token-by-token streaming. Inline diff viewer. Tool call approval from your phone.

OpenCode Mobile — MIT, free, no backend of mine.

**Tweet 2 (the problem)**
```
The problem: opencode runs a long coding session on my server. I leave my desk.

SSH + terminal loses the session UX. Generic AI chat apps have no concept of file diffs or tool call approval.

I needed a real client, not a workaround.

**Tweet 3 (how it works)**
```
How it works:

opencode exposes an HTTP + SSE API. The app speaks that — streaming output, session state, diffs, tool calls.

Your code stays on your server. Your AI provider keys stay on your server. The app is a thin client. No proxy, no middleman.

**Tweet 4 (features)**
```
What you get:

→ Watch your AI agent generate code token by token
→ See every file diff before it's written
→ Approve or reject shell commands and file writes
→ Manage multiple sessions
→ Connect via Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or local network
```

**Tweet 5 (technical credibility)**
```
Works with any model opencode supports: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or local LLMs via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Your keys. Your hardware. Your inference budget.
