# Show HN: OpenCode Mobile – Android client for the opencode AI coding agent

**Title:** Show HN: OpenCode Mobile – drive your self-hosted AI coding agent from your phone

---

Hey HN,

I built a React Native / Expo Android app that lets you control a running [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) session from your phone.

**What it does**

opencode (sst/opencode, MIT) is a terminal-based AI coding agent — you run it on your laptop or a server, it talks to Claude / GPT-4 / Gemini via your own API keys, and it writes, edits, and runs code through tool calls. The mobile app is a thin HTTP + SSE client that connects to the opencode server process. From your phone you can:

- Watch token-by-token streaming output as the agent reasons and codes
- Review inline file diffs before they're committed
- Approve or reject tool calls (file writes, shell commands) in real time
- Start, resume, and switch between sessions
- Connect over local Wi-Fi, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or Tailscale

**Why I built it**

I run long opencode sessions that outlast my desk time. I wanted to check in from the couch, approve a tool call, and let the agent keep going. Every alternative — SSH + terminal app, plain Claude/GPT apps — loses the structured session state. The opencode HTTP API is already there; the phone just needed a proper client.

**How it's built**

- React Native + Expo SDK 54, TypeScript throughout
- SSE streaming via `EventSource` polyfill (React Native lacks a native one)
- Diff rendering with a custom line-level parser; no WebView
- Biometric auth via `expo-local-authentication` gates the app and individual sends
- Credentials in the Android Keystore via `expo-secure-store`
- CI builds a signed APK + AAB on every tag via GitHub Actions (Gradle)

**What it is not**

It's not a standalone AI model and not a code editor. You need a running opencode server. If you already use opencode, setup is: `npm install -g opencode-ai && opencode serve`, then paste the URL in the app.

**Status**

Stable on Android. MIT licensed. Available now via a self-hosted F-Droid repo or a direct signed APK. Google Play is in internal testing and not public yet.

Happy to answer questions about the SSE streaming implementation, the Expo build pipeline, or the opencode API surface.
