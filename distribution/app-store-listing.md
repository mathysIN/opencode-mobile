```
(165 chars)

### Description (max 4000 chars)

```
OpenCode is an open-source mobile client for the opencode AI coding agent (github.com/sst/opencode). Connect to your self-hosted opencode server and drive AI-powered coding sessions directly from your iPhone or iPad.

KEY FEATURES

• Multiple connection types — local network (Wi-Fi), secure tunnels (Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok), or cloud-hosted opencode instances
• Biometric unlock — Face ID / Touch ID to keep your sessions private
• Real-time streaming chat — watch your AI agent think and respond live as it works through your code
• File diff viewer — see exactly what code changes the agent proposes before you accept them
• Multi-session management — start, resume, and switch between coding sessions
• Tool call approval — review and approve file writes, shell commands, and other actions before the agent executes them on your code

WHO IT'S FOR

• Developers who run opencode on their workstation or a server and want to check in from their phone
• Engineers away from their desk who want to guide long-running AI coding sessions
• Teams who self-host AI dev tools and want a polished mobile companion

WHAT IT IS NOT

• Not an AI model — you bring your own opencode server (which connects to Claude, GPT, Gemini, or local models via your API keys)
• Not a code editor — pairs with your existing IDE and terminal workflow
• Not a subscription service — the app is free and open source

OPEN SOURCE

OpenCode Mobile is MIT licensed. Source code, issue tracker, and community discussion:
https://github.com/dzianisv/opencode-mobile

PRIVACY

OpenCode Mobile does not collect your code, prompts, or AI responses. All AI traffic goes directly from the app to YOUR opencode server — never through our infrastructure. We use Sentry for crash reporting only (no personally identifiable information, no message content). See our privacy policy for full details.

SELF-HOSTED FIRST

OpenCode requires you to run an opencode server:
1. Install: npm install -g opencode-ai
2. Run: opencode serve
3. Connect the app to the server URL

If you cannot self-host, contact support@agentlabs.cc and we will provide a temporary review endpoint.

## Age Rating Questionnaire

Apple uses a questionnaire to assign an age rating. Answer as follows for OpenCode Mobile:

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cartoon or fantasy violence | None | Dev tool — no violence content |
| Realistic violence | None | |
| Prolonged graphic violence | None | |
| Sexual content or nudity | None | |
| Profanity or crude humor | None | |

| Gambling | None | |
| Contests | None | |
| Unrestricted web access | No | App connects to user-specified servers only, no general browser |
| Sharing location data | No | |
| User-generated content | No | Chat is between user and their own AI backend, not user-to-user |

**Expected rating: 4+** (no objectionable content; developer tool)

## Privacy Nutrition Label (App Privacy)

Apple requires you to declare what data the app collects. Fill the App Privacy section in App Store Connect as follows.

### Data Not Collected

OpenCode Mobile does NOT collect any of the following:
- Name, Email address, Phone number, Physical address, Other contact info
- Health/fitness data
- Financial info, payment info
- Precise or coarse location
- Contacts
- Emails or text messages
- Photos or videos
- Audio data
- Gameplay content
- Customer support data
- Browsing history, search history
- Sensitive info
- User content (code, prompts, AI responses are not sent to our servers)
- User ID (the app has no accounts or user identity)

### Data Linked to You: None

### Data Not Linked to You

| Data Type | Category | Purpose | Optional? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crash Data | Diagnostics | App functionality | Yes — explicit opt-in |
| Performance Data | Diagnostics | App functionality | Yes — explicit opt-in |
| Other Diagnostic Data | Diagnostics | App functionality | Yes — explicit opt-in |
| Device ID | Identifiers | App functionality | Yes — Sentry installation ID with explicit opt-in |

**Explanation**: Sentry crash reporting sends device model, OS version, app version, and stack traces. Sentry assigns an anonymous installation ID (not linked to any Apple ID or personal information). No user-generated content (code, prompts, responses) is ever sent.

**Sentry opt-in status**: Crash reporting is off by default. The first-launch consent prompt and Settings → Privacy toggle control it. Declining does not initialize Sentry; turning it off later closes the active SDK and stops new event capture.

**"Are you or your third-party partners using this data to track users?"**: No

**App Tracking Transparency (ATT)**: OpenCode Mobile does **not** use the ATT framework (`AppTrackingTransparency`) and does **not** access the IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers). No ad networks or cross-app tracking SDKs are present. No ATT permission prompt is shown to users.

---

## Export Compliance

Apple asks about encryption during submission. Answer:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does the app use encryption beyond what is in the operating system? | No |
| Does the app qualify for any exemptions? | N/A |

**Rationale**: OpenCode Mobile uses only standard HTTPS/TLS provided by iOS networking APIs (URLSession via React Native's fetch). It does not implement any custom cryptographic algorithms. Per US Export Administration Regulations (EAR), apps using only standard OS-provided encryption and that do not modify the encryption are exempt from ERN requirements. Source: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations

**Action**: In App Store Connect > App Information > Export Compliance, select "No" when asked if the app uses non-exempt encryption.

## App Review Notes — ATS Justification

The app's `Info.plist` sets `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads: true` in `NSAppTransportSecurity`. Apple App Store review may ask for justification. Paste the following in the **App Review Notes** field in App Store Connect, or in the reviewer communication:

---

**Justification for NSAllowsArbitraryLoads:**

OpenCode is a developer tool that connects to user-self-hosted opencode CLI servers. These servers typically run on `localhost` or a LAN address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:4096`) over plain HTTP. Requiring TLS would prevent the app from functioning as designed for the dev-tool use case, because:

1. The opencode server (`opencode serve`) serves over plain HTTP by default. Requiring the user to configure TLS certificates for a localhost developer tool is an unreasonable burden.
2. The connection targets are the user's **own** machines, not third-party services. There is no user-to-user data exchange and no third-party server communication through this code path.
3. `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` is explicitly set to `false` — we only relax ATS for the app's own network calls to the user-configured backend.

This is exactly the use case Apple's own documentation acknowledges when describing developer tools and enterprise apps that connect to custom internal servers. Reference: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity

We do not weaken security for any user-facing content delivered by third parties. If the reviewer requires additional justification or a demonstration, we are happy to provide a screen recording or a live server endpoint.

## App Review Information

### Sign-in Required

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Sign-in required? | No — the app does not have user accounts |

### App Access Notes

Paste the following in the "Notes" field of the App Review Information section:

```
OpenCode Mobile requires the reviewer to connect to an opencode server.

OPTION A — We provide a hosted review endpoint:
Contact support@agentlabs.cc before the review window and we will email a temporary server URL valid for 72 hours.

OPTION B — Self-host (5 minutes):
1. Install Node.js 20+ on any macOS/Linux machine
2. Run: npm install -g opencode-ai
3. Run: opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0
4. The terminal prints a URL like: http://192.168.x.x:4096
5. In the app: tap "Add Connection" → enter that URL → tap "Connect"
6. Tap "New Session" → type any prompt (e.g. "list files in current directory")
7. Observe streaming response and tool call approval flow

Note: The --hostname 0.0.0.0 flag makes the server listen on all interfaces
so the iOS device (or simulator) on the same Wi-Fi network can reach it.
Without it, the server only accepts connections from localhost.

The app has no hidden features or paywalls. All functionality is accessible after connecting to a server.
```
