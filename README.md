# OpenCode Mobile

**The open-source Android client for the [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) AI coding agent.**
AI-assisted coding from your phone — Android, via Google Play, F-Droid, or a direct APK.

**New: tap "Try a Demo" in the app to see the agent fix a real bug — reasoning, a grep, a diff, a permission prompt — in about 30 seconds, no server needed.**

## Install (Android)

There are **three working ways** to install OpenCode Mobile today, all for Android:

1. **Google Play** — **https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.agentlabs.opencode**

2. **F-Droid (self-hosted repo)** — add our self-hosted repo to any F-Droid client, then install/update from there:
   ```
   https://dzianisv.github.io/opencode-mobile/fdroid/repo
   ```
   In the F-Droid app: **Settings → Repositories → + (add)** and paste the URL above. Current version: **v0.4.7**.

3. **Direct signed APK** — download the latest release and install it manually:
   **https://github.com/dzianisv/opencode-mobile/releases/latest**

> iOS is not available (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)). IzzyOnDroid submission is pending.

OpenCode Mobile is a React Native / Expo app that brings the power of the [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) AI coding agent to your phone. Connect to your own self-hosted opencode server over your local network, a Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or Tailscale — and write, review, and ship code from anywhere. The mobile client is **free and open-source** under the MIT license. There is no feature gate, no telemetry you did not opt into, and no ad network.

</p>

<sub>Real on-device capture: add a connection, browse sessions, and watch the agent stream a response. Verified end-to-end on an Android emulator against a live opencode server (build cc.agentlabs.opencode).</sub>

---

## Features

- **Offline demo mode** — tap "Try a Demo" to see a full bug-fix walkthrough (reasoning → grep → diff → permission prompt) with zero setup, right from the empty state
- **Multi-connection** — manage multiple opencode servers (local network, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or Tailscale)
- **Biometric unlock** — Face ID, Touch ID, or Android fingerprint protects the app and individual message sends
- **Streaming chat** — token-by-token streaming responses directly from your opencode server
- **Diff viewer** — inline side-by-side diffs of every file change the agent makes
- **Tool call approval** — review and approve (or reject) tool calls before the agent executes them
- **Secure credential storage** — server credentials stored in the Android Keystore via `expo-secure-store`
- **Session management** — browse, create, and resume coding sessions

## Quick Start

**Don't have a server yet?** Install the app and tap **Try a Demo** on the Sessions screen first — no setup required. It plays back a scripted bug-fix session through the app's real chat, diff, and permission-approval UI, offline, in about 30 seconds.

**Step 1 — Start opencode on your machine**

```bash
# Install opencode (if you haven't already)
npm install -g opencode-ai

# Run opencode in server mode
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096
```

**Step 2 — Install OpenCode Mobile** via [Google Play, F-Droid, or a direct APK](#install-android) (or build from source — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

**Step 3 — Add a connection in the app**

Open the app, tap **Add Connection**, and choose your connection type:

- **Local network** — your machine's LAN IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:4096`
- **Tunnel** — a Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok URL, e.g. `https://my-opencode.trycloudflare.com`
- **Tailscale** — your machine's Tailscale IP, e.g. `http://100.x.x.x:4096`
- **opencode Cloud** *(planned — not yet shipped)* — one-tap managed hosting, no server to run

Enter the password you set in Step 1, tap **Connect**, and you're in.

## How It Works

OpenCode Mobile is a thin client. It speaks the opencode HTTP + SSE API: listing sessions, sending messages, streaming responses, and subscribing to file-change events. All AI model calls are handled by your opencode server — you bring your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and the app never touches them. The app never proxies your code or conversation through our servers.

Near-term priorities:
- opencode Cloud one-tap connect + managed hosting
- F-Droid mainline acceptance (FCM audit + reproducible build verification)
- Tunnel setup wizard (Cloudflare / ngrok / Tailscale)
- iPad / tablet layout
- Offline session history cache
