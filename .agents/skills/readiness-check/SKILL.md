# OpenCode Mobile — Readiness Check

Single command that answers one question: **is OpenCode Mobile production ready?**

"Production ready" has a precise definition of done:

- The app is **PUBLISHED on Google Play** (`cc.agentlabs.opencode`).
- The app is **PUBLISHED on F-Droid mainline** (`f-droid.org/packages/cc.agentlabs.opencode`).
- The **self-hosted F-Droid repo** serves the latest APK.
- The **app builds and tests green** (typecheck + node:test suite).
- The **web presence** (landing, guide, privacy, sitemap, robots, OG image, QR codes) is all live.

If, and only if, every REQUIRED gate passes, the verdict is `PRODUCTION READY`.

## How to run

From the repo root (the check is a TypeScript file run directly by Node — no build, no deps):

```bash
node .agents/skills/readiness-check/check.ts
```

Fast mode — skip the slow npm app-health gates, only check live published-status URLs:

```bash
node .agents/skills/readiness-check/check.ts --quick
```

Requires **Node ≥ 23.6** (this repo runs Node 26), which executes `.ts` files natively via
type-stripping — no transpile or extra dependencies. HTTP checks use the built-in `fetch`
and JSON parsing is native, so there is no `curl`/`jq`/`python3` dependency. `git` is used to
locate the repo root and `gh` for the optional repo-discoverability gate; both degrade
gracefully if missing (gate reports `WARN`/`UNKNOWN`, never crashes).

## What it checks

Gates are grouped. REQUIRED gates decide the verdict; nice-to-have gates only WARN.

- **A. App health** (REQUIRED, skipped with `--quick`)
  - `npm run typecheck` exits clean.
  - `npm test` passes.
- **B. F-Droid self-hosted repo LIVE** (REQUIRED)
  - `https://dzianisv.github.io/opencode-mobile/fdroid/repo/index-v1.json` parses and contains `cc.agentlabs.opencode`; prints served versionName.
  - `https://github.com/dzianisv/opencode-mobile/releases/latest` returns 200/3xx.
- **C. F-Droid MAINLINE published** (REQUIRED, headline)
  - `https://f-droid.org/packages/cc.agentlabs.opencode/` returns 200. A 404 means not yet merged on f-droid.org → this gate FAILS. Do not confuse with the self-hosted gate (B).
- **D. Google Play PUBLISHED** (REQUIRED, headline)
  - `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.agentlabs.opencode` returns 200 with a real store page. While in-review/draft it 404s → gate FAILS.
- **E. Web presence** (REQUIRED)
  - landing `/`, `/guide/`, `/privacy/`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `og.png`, `fdroid-qr.png`, `apk-qr.png` under `https://dzianisv.github.io/opencode-mobile/` all return 200.
- **F. Repo discoverability** (nice-to-have, WARN only)
  - `gh repo view dzianisv/opencode-mobile --json repositoryTopics,homepageUrl` shows topics + homepage. Skipped gracefully if `gh` is missing/unauthenticated.

## Interpreting results

Each gate prints one line: `[PASS] / [FAIL] / [WARN] / [UNKNOWN] <gate> — <detail>`.

The summary at the bottom is the answer:

- **`PRODUCTION READY ✅`** — every REQUIRED gate passed. Both stores are live, app and site healthy. Script exits `0`.
- **`NOT READY ❌`** — at least one REQUIRED gate failed; the failing gates are listed. Script exits `1`.

The two headline gates are **D (Google Play)** and **C (F-Droid mainline)** because
"published on both stores" is the definition of done. Until Play review completes and
the F-Droid mainline MR is merged, expect those two to FAIL and the verdict to be NOT READY —
that is correct behavior, not a script bug.

`UNKNOWN` means a network/tool problem prevented the check (e.g. offline). UNKNOWN on a
REQUIRED gate is treated as not-passing, so the verdict will be NOT READY.
